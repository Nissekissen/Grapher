# Grapher
Simple Grapher program using node.js.

Download and install the required dependencies with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nissekissen/Grapher.git
cd Grapher
npm install
```

By running the `index.js` file with `npm start`, you generate an image placed in a `graphs` folder. The `index.js` file is only an 
example and it can be modified however you want. I don't expect anyone to use this, since it's pretty pointless, but it has an MIT-lisence
so you can copy, sell, modify the code however you want, I don't care.

Made with nodejs and it uses [mathjs](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) for expression parsing and [@napi-rs/canvas](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn/canvas) for
image rendering.
